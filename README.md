## Goal of the ML project
We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.
## Result
This project successfully obtained 98.24% accuracy with XGBoost Classifier.
## Conclusion

After training all algorithms, we found that Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are given high accuracy than remaining but we have chosen XGBoost.

## Contribution

Please share your feedback and doubt regarding this ML project by opening issues or pull requests!

I hope you enjoy the Machine Learning End to End project. Thank youâ€¦.. -:)
